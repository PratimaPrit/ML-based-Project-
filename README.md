Animal Image Classification Project
Overview
Welcome to our animal image classification project! In this study, we delve into the fascinating world of animal images with a dataset containing 90 unique images. Our goal is to explore various classification tasks using this dataset, ranging from simple one-vs-rest binary classification to a more complex 5-class classification challenge.

Classification Techniques
One-vs-Rest Classification
We start by organizing the data for one-vs-rest classification. This approach involves training separate classifiers for each class while treating all other classes as a single entity. Through this iterative process, we aim to develop multiple classifiers, each adept at distinguishing one class from the rest.

5-Class Classification
Moving on to a more intricate challenge, we tackle the 5-class classification scenario. Here, our objective is to build a classification model capable of accurately categorizing each input image into one of five predefined classes. This task requires a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and robust model architecture.

Model Analysis
We analyze the dataset using three distinct architectures:

Custom Neural Network with Attention Mechanism
MobileNet
EfficientNet
Evaluation Metrics
To assess the performance of our classification models, we employ classification matrices. These matrices offer a holistic view of the model's efficacy by showcasing key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. By scrutinizing these metrics, we gain valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each classification approach, aiding us in making informed decisions regarding model selection and refinement.
